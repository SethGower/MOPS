Hello Graders,

Just a note for when you are grading this. If you open up the debug1.txt,
debug2.txt and debu3.txt, and notice the funky escape characters, that is because I used
gdb's logging functionality to record the output and input of my gdb results,
so I didn't have to bother copying and pasting. Vim doesn't render these
properly (unless you have an appropriate plugin), so to make it look not ugly,
I recommend simply using cat to output the file. 

Sincerely, 
Seth Gower
