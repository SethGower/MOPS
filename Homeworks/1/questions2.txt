8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -c main.c circle.c

    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -o broken main.o circle.o

    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        Because the function declaration in circle.c for the area funciton is
        "getAreas" when the main.c is calling "getArea" (this took me wayyyyy
        too long to notice)
