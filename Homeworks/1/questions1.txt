1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    /home/stu1/s11/sdg7234

2. What command will list the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories without descending into any directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    ls

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    cd Courses/

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled as:
        gcc -o warning warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems, but there are issues.

    a.) What compiler flags are used to enable the display of warnings?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        -Wall: Enable "all" warnings
        -Wextra: Enable _extra_ warnings
        -Werror: Change warnings to errors
        -pedantic: Be pickier

    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c
	with the recommended compilation options.

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        Using the compilation flags, mentioned above in 5a, the program was
        compiled and a number of errors were produced

            - The "compute" function had a couple of warnings, one of which
              was the variable "b" was never used, but it was created. In
              addition to this, the function is defined as an int function,
              but it never returns any values.
            - There are a couple of errors and warnings in "main". One of
              which is the fact that an array is being defined using the macro
              "SIZE", which is 0, and thus an array is being defined with a
              size of 0, which is prohibited. Since an array is being defined
              with a size of 0, the 1 inside of the array declaration, that is
              contradicting the size.
            - The main method has also been created incorrectly. If you are
              going to use argc, you should also use argv. But since argc is
              never used, it can be removed from the parameter list.

    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly to
	produce the output specified in the code documentation.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

    d.) There is a 'super-picky' warning flag; what is it and what problem
	does it catch in warning.c?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        I don't know. I used pedantic originally

first to last.
