[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[ ] crash?
	[ ] infinite loop when it should not?
	[ ] only work in printed mode?
	[x] work fine?
	[ ] only implement these options: [list them below]
	[ ] other? Explain below.


How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.

    The move algorithm simply iterates through all of the cells in the board,
    and the new board. Once it finds a cell that is vacant in both, it copies
    it there. If no valid cell is found, it stays in place. 

============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?


============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

    Even though I was familiar, this project gave me more experience and
    really did reinforce my knowledge of structs and enums. 

What was easy about this assignment?

    The use of pointers and arrays. I am very familiar with pointers and
    pointer manipulation

What gave you problems or troubles?

    I ran into some problems with my move algorithm, specifically with my
    findNextVacantCell function. Occasionally, it would delete cells and make
    them vacant, so it seemed like the teams were murdering each other. 


What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

    Actually pretty great as it is.

What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

    Use actual ncurses library. Also use getoptlongonly, which I didn't feel
    comfortable doing it since I wasn't allowed to change the help text.
